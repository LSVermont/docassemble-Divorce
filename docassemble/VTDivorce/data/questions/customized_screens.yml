id: documents serving to other party
question: |
  Documents you are "serving" (sending or delivering to) the other party
subquestion: |
  As part of the court process, you must “serve” copies of all the forms you file with the court on your spouse (or their lawyer, if they have one). To serve means to send or deliver documents. You also need to provide proof to the court that the forms were sent or delivered to your spouse. There are different ways to do that. See the [Vermont Judiciary website](https://www.vermontjudiciary.org/family/divorce/serving-papers) for full details.
  
  Below are some common Family Court documents. Choose those that you want to appear on the service form. Select Next to have the chance to enter the names of other forms and documents you may be serving.
